# Stone-Paper-Scissor-gui-based
I have tried to create a Stone Paper Scissor game based on GUI interface. For which I have learnt the basic concepts from various resources like Youtube, etc.  
and tried to add up some more features on that !

Simply install all the modules required for the game

Installing Tkinter by :-
pip install tk

Installing Pygame by :-
pip install pygame

Installing PIL by :-
Pip install pillow

All other mmodules are preinstalled with python So we don't need to install them separately

Now just simply Clone this project onto your system and run the .py file
